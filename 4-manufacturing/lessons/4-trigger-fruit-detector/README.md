## Introduction

An IoT application is not just a single device capturing data and sending it to the cloud, it is more often that not multiple devices all working together to capture data from the physical world using sensors, make decisions based off that data, and interacting back with the physical world via actuators or visualizations.

In this lesson you will learn more about architecting complex IoT applications, incorporating multiple sensors, multiple cloud services to analyze and store data, and showing a response via an actuator. You will piece together a more advanced fruit quality tracking system.

In this lesson we'll cover:

* [Architect complex IoT applications](#architect-complex-iot-applications)
* [Design a fruit quality control system](#design-a-fruit-quality-control-system)
* [Trigger fruit quality checking from a sensor](#trigger-fruit-quality-checking-from-a-sensor)
* [Store fruit quality data](#store-fruit-quality-data)
* [Control feedback via an actuator](#control-feedback-via-an-actuator)
